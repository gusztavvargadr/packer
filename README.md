# Packer

This repository contains [Packer] templates for building Windows and Ubuntu images in various development scenarios.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The templates [have been upgraded][PackerJSONToHCL] from Packer's legacy JSON format to use the newer HCL format, resulting in breaking changes in the image build process.  
>  
> To upgrade your fork or other customizations to the newer HCL format, please follow the documentation on [contributing]. Feature updates and bug fixes will be available only in this version in the future.
>  
> To continue using the version based on the legacy JSON format, use the tag of the [2310.0.0][LastJSONRelease] release. Feature updates and bug fixes will not be backported to this version in the future.
